        <p>
          Founded in Westmoreland, a parish known for its breathtaking
          coastlines, lush farmlands, and grounded people,
          <strong>RUne State</strong> blends island craftsmanship with bold
          innovation. Here, where cane fields meet cliffs and rivers cut paths
          through red soil, we saw an opportunity to carve a new identity into
          timekeeping — one that reflects the resilience, soul, and authenticity
          of Jamaican life.

      <p>Each <strong>RUne State</strong> watch begins with intent:</p>

      <div id="story">
        <p>
          Our Story Westmoreland, with its stunning coastlines, rolling cane
          fields, and close-knit communities, inspired us to craft something
          unique — a timepiece that honors our culture and tells a story with
          every tick. The name RUne State draws from the ancient tradition of
          runes — symbols carved into stone that captured history and wisdom.
          Like those runes, our watches are designed to carry meaning, legacy,
          and identity forward through time.

            Locally inspired materials, textures, and color palettes that echo
            the land — from the golds of a Negril sunset to the deep blacks of
            rich soil.

          <li>
            Minimalist, rugged design representing both strength and elegance —
            like the Jamaican people who carry themselves with both pride and
            grace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unapologetically bold names and models inspired by old Jamaican

        <p>
          Our Commitment to Community We’re not just about watches — we’re about
          people. A percentage of every sale supports youth programs in
          Westmoreland, empowering the next generation to dream big and achieve
          greatness. When you wear RUne State, you’re joining a movement that
          values heritage, purpose, and progress.
